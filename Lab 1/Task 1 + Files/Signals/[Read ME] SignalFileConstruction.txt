The file will contain the samples in time domain or frequency domain,
Follows is a description for how to build such a file:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[SignalType] // Time-->0/Freq-->1
[IsPeriodic] // takes 0 or 1
[N1] // number of samples to follow or number of frequencies to follow 
[Index SampleAmp] or [Freq Amp PhaseShift]// N1 rows follow with Sample Index followed by space followed by Sample Amplitude in case Time domain was specified in the first row in the file, or N1 rows follow with frequency followed by space followed by amplitude followed by Phase shift
